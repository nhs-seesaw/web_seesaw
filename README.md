Consultation Aid.

Flexible tool aimed at helping patients and doctors explore difficult decisions, and choose between 2 options. 

Tool first asks patient to reflect on what their goals are, and select their relative importance. Each goal is represented visually by a block. Then a doctor / nurse discusses each goal, and whether it leans more toward option 1 or option 2. Again this is done visually, by placing the blocks on a see-saw.

Finally, the see-saw is balanced, and the patient can see how their goals might sway them more towards a particular option.
